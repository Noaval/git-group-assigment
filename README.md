# GIT and GITHUB Group Assignments

1. Clone the repo locally to your computer.
2. Make a new branch with the name of your group
    - Name your group
    - One of you might have to fork the repo and invite your teammates.

Each group has a sub-folder.
Within that folder, you will find a list of facts in a `.md` file
(we will learn more about these types of files next week).

Your job, as a group, is to (1) fact check these facts and correct any mistakes you might find
(**TIP**: it might be *faster* to work in smaller sub-groups!),
and (2) add some facts of your own.

Don't forget to commit and push your changes, and to fetch the changes made my your teammates.
(be careful of creating any conflicts!)

Once your team is done, make a pull-request to the `main` branch, and review it.

EACH of the your teammates must make at least one commit.

***Good luck!***
